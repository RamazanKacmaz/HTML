# HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is an abbreviation for "Hypertext Markup Language," and it is a standard markup language used for creating web pages. HTML is used to organize and format text, links, images, videos, and other media elements on web pages.

Additionally, HTML specifies the structure and elements of a web page. For example, a web page may contain different elements such as headings, subheadings, paragraphs, lists, and tables. HTML pages are coded for web browsers to understand these elements. Browsers read the HTML code and present the web page to the user.

HTML is not a programming language, but it is necessary for designing and creating web pages. HTML can be used in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create more dynamic and impressive web pages.
